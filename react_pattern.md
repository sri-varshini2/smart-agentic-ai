## 🔍 What is ReAct?

**ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting) is a powerful pattern for building agentic AI systems. It combines:

- **Re**asoning: The ability to think step-by-step about a problem
- **Act**ing: Taking concrete actions based on that reasoning

The ReAct pattern enables language models to solve complex tasks by interleaving:
1. Deliberate reasoning traces (thinking)
2. Task-specific actions (doing)

This creates a synergistic loop where reasoning guides actions, and the results of actions inform further reasoning.

At its core, a ReAct agent consists of:

- A central **Agent** component that orchestrates the process
- An **LLM** (Large Language Model) that powers reasoning capabilities
- **Tools** that enable the agent to take actions in the world

The key innovation is how these components interact in a continuous loop:

1. The LLM generates reasoning about the current situation
2. Based on reasoning, the agent selects appropriate tools
3. Tools are executed to generate observations
4. Observations are fed back to the LLM for further reasoning

## 🧩 Components of a ReAct Agent

### 1️⃣ LLM (Large Language Model)

The LLM serves as the "brain" of the agent, responsible for:

- Understanding user requests
- Breaking down complex problems
- Deciding which tools to use
- Interpreting results from tool usage
- Generating coherent responses

Common LLMs include:
- GPT models (OpenAI)
- Claude models (Anthropic)
- Llama models (Meta)
- Mistral models (Mistral AI)

### 2️⃣ Tools

Tools are functions or APIs that enable the agent to:

- Retrieve information (search engines, databases)
- Perform calculations
- Interact with external systems
- Manipulate data
- Execute code

Examples of common tools:
- Web search
- Calculator
- Code interpreter
- Knowledge base retrieval
- APIs (weather, stocks, etc.)

### 3️⃣ Agent Framework

The agent framework:
- Manages the interaction between the LLM and tools
- Maintains context and state
- Handles error cases
- Implements the ReAct loop
- Provides interfaces for human interaction

## ⚙️ ReAct in Action

Here's a simplified example of the ReAct pattern in action:

1. **User Request**: "What's the weather in New York and should I bring an umbrella?"

2. **Reasoning**: "To answer this question, I need to check the current weather in New York and see if rain is in the forecast."

3. **Action**: *Uses weather API tool to get forecast for New York*

4. **Observation**: "Current weather in New York: 65°F, 80% chance of rain this afternoon."

5. **Reasoning**: "With an 80% chance of rain, it would be wise to bring an umbrella."

6. **Response**: "The weather in New York is currently 65°F with an 80% chance of rain this afternoon. Yes, you should definitely bring an umbrella."

This simple example demonstrates the core ReAct pattern: reasoning about what information is needed, taking an action to get that information, observing the results, reasoning again, and finally providing a response.

## 💻 Implementation Guide

To implement a basic ReAct agent:

1. **Define your tools**: Create functions that can be called with parameters and return results.

2. **Create prompt templates**: Design prompts that encourage the LLM to:
   - Reason step by step
   - Consider which tools to use
   - Generate tool calls with correct parameters
   - Interpret results from tools

3. **Implement the ReAct loop**:
   ```python
   def react_loop(user_input, max_iterations=5):
       context = [user_input]
       
       for i in range(max_iterations):
           # Get reasoning and action from LLM
           reasoning, action = get_reasoning_and_action(context)
           
           # Execute the action using tools
           observation = execute_tool(action)
           
           # Add to context
           context.append(reasoning)
           context.append(f"Action: {action}")
           context.append(f"Observation: {observation}")
           
           # Check if we're done
           if should_finish(context):
               break
       
       # Generate final response
       return generate_response(context)
   ```

4. **Handle edge cases**: Implement error handling for cases like:
   - Tool failures
   - Invalid tool parameters
   - Infinite loops
   - Hallucinated tool calls
